Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a research engineer at [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence](https://eng.bigai.ai/). Previously I recieved my master degree in Intelligence Science and Technology from Peking University (2020-2023) and my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Peking University (2016-2020).

My research interest include: Embodied AI, Multi-Modal Learning, Quantitative Trading, Bioinformatics and Graph Rresentation Learning. 



Experiences
======
2022.7-2022.12, Research Intern, Microsoft Research Aisa. 
We won the second place in the NeurIPS 2022 OGB-LSC challenge, which is a competition of link prediction on huge knowledge graphs. Our solution can be found [here](https://ogb.stanford.edu/paper/neurips2022/wikikg90mv2_DNAKG.pdf).
