Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a research engineer at [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence](https://eng.bigai.ai/). Previously I recieved my master degree in Intelligence Science and Technology from Peking University (2020-2023) and my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Peking University (2016-2020).

My research interest include: Embodied AI, Multi-Modal Learning, Bioinformatics and Graph Rresentation Learning. I am also intrested in Quantitative Trading.



Experiences
======
2022.7-2022.12, Research Intern, Microsoft Research Aisa.\
We won the **second place** in the NeurIPS 2022 OGB-LSC challenge, which is a competition of link prediction on huge knowledge graphs. Our technical report can be found [here](https://ogb.stanford.edu/paper/neurips2022/wikikg90mv2_DNAKG.pdf).



Publications
======
**Yue Fan**, Xiaojian Ma, Rujie Wu, Yuntao Du, Jiaqi Li, Zhi Gao, Qing Li. VideoAgent: A Memory-augmented Multimodal Agent for Video Understanding. arxiv 2024. [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11481.pdf)]\
We build VideoAgent that understands long videos and achieves the performance close to Gemini 1.5 Pro. Details can be found [here](https://videoagent.github.io). We are now building real-time VideoAgent.

Jun Guo, Xiaojian Ma, **Yue Fan**, Huaping Liu, Qing Li. Semantic Gaussians: Open-Vocabulary Scene Understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting. arxiv 2024. [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15624.pdf)]\
This work reconstructs the 3D scenes and perserves the semantic information using Gaussian splatting.


Tianxu Wang, **Yue Fan**, Xiuli Ma. Attention Based Models for Cell Type Classification on Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data. ECAI 2023. [[pdf][(https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/64489)]]\
We build two kinds of attention-based model to predict the types of the cells. We found the attention weights to be a good interpretation for cell-type classification. **This paper is awarded as the outstanding paper for AI in socal good.**

**Yue Fan**, Xiuli Ma. Multi-vector embedding on networks with taxonomies. IJCAI 2022. [[pdf](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0408.pdf)]\
We build a novel graph embedding method that adaptively learns multiple representation vectors for each node in a hyperbolic space.


**Yue Fan**, Xiuli Ma. Gene regulatory network inference using 3D convolutional neural network. AAAI 2021. [[pdf](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16082)]\
A 3D convolutional neural network is built and serves a good gene regulatory network predictor.

Junshan Wang, Zhicong Lu, Guojia Song, **Yue Fan**, Lun Du, Wei Lin. Tag2vec: Learning tag representations in tag networks. WWW 2019. [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03041.pdf)]\
Tag2Vec learns the embedding of both the nodes and their tags in a hyperbolic space.
